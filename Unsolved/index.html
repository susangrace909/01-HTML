    <p style="background-color: lemonchiffon;">Hello! My name is Susan Pero. I grew up in Orlando, Florida, and have
       lived here my whole life. I originally studied Music Education and 
       the University of Florida, where I received my Bachelor's and 
       Master's. I taught elementary music for three years before going back
       to school. I then went to Valencia College where I got my Associate's
       in Plant Science. From there, I became Head Grower at a local cactus 
       nursery. Currently I am in charge of keeping plants alive from the 
       time we receive them until we sell them. This means my duties range 
       from watering, to scouting for pests, to spraying chemicals. I am 
       choosing to leave the profession because it is a very physical job 
       and I know that it is not sustainable. I would like to transition to 
       a job that will be doable for the rest of my career.
